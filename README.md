Basic python program that implements a multi-clipboard. The idea is to store multiple items on a clipboard. 
Problem - We can only copy and paste 1 item at a time onto a clipboard.
To combat this, we allow multiple items to be copied, and then 'load' it onto the clipboard.
This program also allows us to copy from the clipboard and paste elsewhere
