Basic python program that implements a multi-clipboard. The idea is to store multiple items on a clipboard. 
Problem - Traditional clipboards are only able to store 1 item which we can use
To combat this, we allow multiple items to be stored on the clipboard. We can access these items using keys which we provide when we save items to the clipboard. 
Modify the existing python clipboard, which can only store 1 item at a time.
